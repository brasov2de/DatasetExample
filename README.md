# DatasetExample

In this branch I try to link a dataset to another dataset by using a many-to-many relationship.
Unfortunately, it turns out that this one doesn't work: we are able to link the dataset, and even get all the associated records in the generated fetchXml, but we cannot read the associated records inside the dataset object.
