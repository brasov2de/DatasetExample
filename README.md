# DatasetExample

This branch is a continuation for the branch 3_multipledatasets_extended_relationship, showing how to add grouping to as DetailsList.
The approach relies on 2 datasets:
 - the first is a subgrid, showing the related records
 - the second is a view, filtered on records linked to the first dataset
